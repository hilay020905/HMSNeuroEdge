# HMSNeuroEdge 🧠⚡

**HMSNeuroEdge** is a research-oriented, open-source processor project focused on **power-efficient execution of Machine Learning (ML) workloads at the edge**. The goal is to design a **lightweight, scalable, and energy-aware processor architecture** that can handle inference-heavy ML tasks while maintaining low power consumption.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Modern edge devices (IoT, wearables, drones, embedded vision systems) demand:

* Low latency ML inference
* Ultra-low power consumption
* Customizable hardware accelerators
* Tight hardware–software co-design

**HMSNeuroEdge** aims to bridge this gap by combining:

* A custom processor core
* ML-oriented architectural extensions
* Power-optimization techniques
* Open-source RTL and software stack

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Design a **power-efficient processor** for ML workloads
* Support **ML inference** (CNNs, MLPs, basic transformers – edge scale)
* Explore **hardware acceleration** for neural operations
* Enable **DVFS and clock gating** for energy savings
* Maintain **FPGA and ASIC-friendly RTL**

---

## 🧩 Planned Architecture

### 🧠 Core

* RISC-based core (RV32 / RV64 – TBD)
* In-order pipeline (power-optimized)
* Optional dual-issue or vector extensions

### ⚙️ ML Acceleration

* MAC units optimized for INT8 / INT16
* SIMD / Vector-style execution
* Optional systolic or tiled compute block
* Support for common ML kernels:

  * Convolution
  * Matrix multiplication
  * Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, GELU – approximated)

### 🔋 Power Optimization

* Clock gating
* Power gating (conceptual / ASIC-level)
* DVFS-aware design
* Reduced memory access via data reuse

---

## 🧠 Software Stack (Planned)

* Custom ISA extensions for ML operations
* Bare-metal runtime
* C/C++ compiler support (LLVM/GCC – later stage)
* Simple ML runtime (TinyML-style)
* Assembly support for critical kernels

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

* **RTL Language**: Verilog / SystemVerilog
* **Simulation**: Verilator / ModelSim
* **FPGA Target**: Xilinx / Intel FPGA (initial validation)
* **Toolchain**: RISC-V GNU Toolchain (if RISC-based)
